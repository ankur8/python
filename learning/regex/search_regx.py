import re
#*?, +?, ??
#The '*', '+', and '?' qualifiers are all greedy;
# they match as much text as possible. Sometimes this behaviour isnâ€™t desired;
# if the RE <.*> is matched against <a> b <c>, it will match the entire string, and not just <a>.
# Adding ? after the qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible
# will be matched. Using the RE <.*?> will match only <a>.
